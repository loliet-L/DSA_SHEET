/*
Given a matrix mat of size N x M where every element is either â€˜Oâ€™ or â€˜Xâ€™.
Replace all â€˜Oâ€™ with â€˜Xâ€™ that are surrounded by â€˜Xâ€™.
A â€˜Oâ€™ (or a set of â€˜Oâ€™) is considered to be by surrounded by â€˜Xâ€™ if there are â€˜Xâ€™ at 
locations just below, just above, just left and just right of it.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5, m = 4
mat = {{'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'}, 
       {'X', 'O', 'X', 'X'}, 
       {'X', 'O', 'O', 'X'}, 
       {'X', 'O', 'X', 'X'}, 
       {'X', 'X', 'O', 'O'}}
Output: ans = {{'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'}, 
               {'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'}, 
               {'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'}, 
               {'X', 'X', 'X', 'X'}, 
               {'X', 'X', 'O', 'O'}}
Explanation: Following the rule the above 
matrix is the resultant matrix.

      // Let's analyze when an 'O' cannot be flipped,
      // if it has atleast one 'O' in it's adjacent, AND ultimately this chain of adjacent 'O's is connected to some
    //    'O' which lies on boundary of board
        
      //consider these two cases for clarity :
      /*
        O's won't be flipped          O's will be flipped
        [X O X X X]                   [X X X X X]     
        [X O O O X]                   [X O O O X]
        [X O X X X]                   [X O X X X] 
        [X X X X X]                   [X X X X X]
      
      So we can conclude if a chain of adjacent O's is connected some O on boundary then they cannot be flipped

      //Steps to Solve :
      //1. Move over the boundary of board, and find O's 
      //2. Every time we find an O, perform DFS from it's position
      //3. In DFS convert all 'O' to '#'      (why?? so that we can differentiate which 'O' can be flipped and which cannot be)   
      //4. After all DFSs have been performed, board contains three elements,#,O and X
      //5. 'O' are left over elements which are not connected to any boundary O, so flip them to 'X'
      //6. '#' are elements which cannot be flipped to 'X', so flip them back to 'O'
      //7. finally, Upvote the solutionðŸ˜Š
